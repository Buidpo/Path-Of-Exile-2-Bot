Bot developed in C# for the game Path of Exile II

The team started this project with the purpose of learning reverse engineering having fun, and after some long time of hard work we finally felt that it would be great to share it and to create a community around it. The bot is still in public beta version but already has a lot of features and is stable.

We are sure that people will enjoy this kind of stuff and we are planning to improve it as much as possible.
